## Exercise 1

### Pipeline

For this exercise, I use the pre-loaded cars dataset and calculate the time taken to cover the distance for each car. Here the transformed data represents the time taken (for all 50 cars) rounded off to two digits.
```{r}
data(cars)

calculate_time <- function(cars) {
  time_taken <- cars$dist/cars$speed
  return(time_taken)
}
time <- calculate_time(cars)
 time_rounded <- round(time,2)
 
 print(time_rounded)
```
2. Next, I bind the transformed data to the cars set by adding a new column called time.

```{r}
cars_new <- cbind(cars, "time" = time_rounded)
print(cars)
```
